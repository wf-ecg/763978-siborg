In the past, our projects have been more short lived. The kind of property-refinement that development teams usually enjoy hasn't been a big part of it. But the breadth of our work brings us a range of new opportunities, and responsive design is a growing concern. — J. D. Buckle

"data site" and "feature site" are combinations of ranges from multiple spectrums 
Spectrum is an example of quantity and quality in tandem; e.g., light THz: 505< yellow >525< green >575

here are our desires, we want you do <blank>
	skips over all the thought
	we want <blank> because we desire <blank>
	we really desire <blank>, what can you do for us

desire precedes strategy
	here are our desires, how do we satisfy them
data precedes feature 
	here’s the data, how do we feature it
function precedes form
	we need to feature this, how shall we form it

	here’s are our goals
		how do we support it
		how do you organize it








Feature is not vs Utility (Feature is a vague word)

Promotion (natural or artifice)
	feature ==> Promotional
	function ==> Utility
	data ==> Utility
	form ==> neutral
	flash ==>  Promotional

Adapting to data qualities, plots & ranges (e.g. thresholds on continuum, such screen widths)

Adaptively react to:
	Responsive (automatic, fluid) detect + respond
		time (meetings, event day)
		place (gps, selection)
		device (lap, desk, palm)
	Interactive  (selected, forced) act + react
		option (choice, preference setting)
		navigation (menu, link, gesture)
